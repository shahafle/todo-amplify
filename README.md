# Amplify Todo App

## Getting started

**Note!** This repository contains only server side of the project. To run the app properly, you have to run client side too.

Head to the repository on top and clone the project or download the files.

```
git clone https://github.com/shahafle/todo-amplify.git
```

Enter the todo-amplify folder and make sure you have node_modules installed. After that we will initiate the server with 'npm start':

```
cd todo-amplify
npm i 
npm start
```

The app is running on http://localhost:3000

Everything is ready! The App should be opened automatically, enjoy!
